# Where is the School? - English Learning Game

This is an interactive web-based game designed to help learners practice prepositions of place in English. Players will be asked to identify the position of a "school" in relation to other buildings like police stations, fire stations, parks, restaurants, and more. The game supports both visual and auditory learning.

## Game Features
- **3x3 Grid Layout**: The game consists of a 3x3 grid, each containing a building or an empty space.
- **Buildings**: The buildings include a police station, fire station, post office, museum, restaurant, library, park, and hospital.
- **Task**: Players need to identify the correct preposition of place (e.g., "in front of", "behind", "next to", "between A and B") for the "school" relative to the other buildings.
- **Voice Feedback**: Upon selecting an answer, the game provides feedback by reading out the correct preposition in English.

## How to Play
1. **Start the game**: The game will generate a 3x3 grid with buildings and place the "school" at a random position.
2. **Choose the correct preposition**: Players will be prompted to choose one of the following:
   - In Front Of

   - Next To
   - Between A and B
3. **Audio Feedback**: After making a choice, the correct answer will be read aloud in English, whether you got it right or wrong.
4. **Score**: The game keeps track of the player's score based on correct answers.
